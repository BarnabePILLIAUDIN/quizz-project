# Quizz project

## What is Quizz project ?

It's my first side project on Node.js and MongoDB.
The target is to add a questions with four answers in a form then store it into a MongoDB database.
You can access this form with /add.
You can also answer the questions in the db in the index page that you can access with / .

## What still need to be done ?

The style is not finished on the index page. But the addQuestion for is finish and working
Even if it's not finished the index page displays the questions but you can't choose an answer yet
